    <p>What is CSS?</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li class="listitem">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li class="listitem">CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper, or in other media.</li>
        <li class="listitem">
            <b>
            <span class="strikeout">
                Css is not necessary
            </span>

                Css saves a lot of work.

            It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
            <span class="underline">
                External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.
            </span>
        </li>
    </ol>

    
        <p>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</p>

        <ul type="disc">
            <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
            <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
            <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
            <li>
                The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. 
                However, <span class="yellowbg"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</span>, because this 
                is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="para">
            When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a s
            tyle to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique 
            element. ID is also special in that you can 
            use a special URL to link directly to an element and itâ€™s used by JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p class="para">
            In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an 
            element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
        </p>

        <p class="para">
            There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. 
            Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
